## 👨‍💻 About Me  

Coding has always been my happy place! From designing sleek web apps to brainstorming cybersecurity solutions, I thrive on solving challenges and building things that make life easier (or cooler 😉).  

I’m currently pursuing my Bachelor's in **Information Technology** at **SPPU** and gearing up to graduate in 2025. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me playing **chess** ♟️, solving **puzzles** 🧩, or diving into something new to learn.
